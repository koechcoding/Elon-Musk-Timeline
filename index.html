                                <p>Founded with the intention of helping dispel city traffic via underground tunnels as a subsidiary of SpaceX, the Boring Company is one of Musk’s side projects. Its aim: build tunnels. They first experimented by tunneling
                                    under the SpaceX factory in California. The Boring Company became an independent entity in 2018, and in 2021 completed a tunnel project in Las Vegas to shuttle visitors beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center. It is
                                    currently working on further tunnel projects in Las Vegas for underground transport. Other projects are primarily speculative. Musk once spoke boldly about an ambitious “Hyperloop” system, creating tunnels across the
                                    country to revolutionize and speed up underground mass transport between cities. However, Hyperloop mentions have been scrubbed from the Boring Company’s website.</p>
